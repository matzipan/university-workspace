@I [SYN-201] Setting up clock 'default' with a period of 20ns.
@W [HLS-40] This current release of Vivado HLS is the last one supporting the following device families including any of their associated derivatives: Virtex-6, Virtex-5, Virtex-4, Spartan-6 and Spartan-3. These families will still be supported in the future but will require this current version of Vivado HLS or a previous one.

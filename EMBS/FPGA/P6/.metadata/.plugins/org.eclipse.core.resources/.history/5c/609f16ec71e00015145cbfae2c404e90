Now, time how long the calculation takes. You will need the timer peripheral as described in the MicroBlaze Software API, and you should only time the calculation loop, not the checking and reporting loop.
The value from the timer is in clock cycles (we're running at 50MHz, or 20ns period). This is not a particularly fast time for 10 divisions. Design and build a 32-bit integer divider in Vivado HLS which takes two values a and b over the AXI Stream, and responds with a/b.
Once you have built and tested your design in HLS, export it and connect it into your XPS system, using the instructions in the Vivado HLS Knowledge Base.
Once you have completed this task notify a demonstrator who will mark it in your logbook. Show the demonstrator the timing you obtained with only the MicroBlaze and the timing with your HLS design.
